# Sea-Monster-Hunt-DIscord-bot-for-BDO
This is my implementation of a SMH bot for discord, it is designed to optimize and organaize efficiently the loot and percentage of cooperation from SMH.
It's designed using the Discord.py API from Rapptz, using the last version (0.16.12) of this one.
The bot can:

     -Create a database for the members
  
     -Clean this DB
  
     -Add loot (Neidans, Pirate coins, 100m drops)
  
     -Register sailors
  
     -Remove sailors
  
     -Send the spreadsheet data via private message 
  
     -Specify the roles that can operate over the bot special functions
  
     -Edit loot
  
     -Check current loot with each member participation.
  

Roles:

     -Sea Director: Has total control over the bot
  
     -Officers:  Can edit the loot and manipulate some features
  
     -Members: can enrole themselves and add loot.
  
  
You can contact me in Discord if need any help setting the bot up.
